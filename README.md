# gab3alm

Source code for my portfolio website - `gab3alm.com`

## Overview

The ultimate goal for this project is to highlight my knowledge and skills so that you can hire me with more confidence :)

This clojurescript project is an experiment to see how well an S3 bucket can serve the frontend of a site.

All that functional goodness is on my side. If you have never heard of `clojurescript` you can visit 

`https://clojurescript.org/`

## Setup

This is a clojurescript project, so you will need to setup your JDK and leiningen in your machine.

If for some reason you want to get my portfolio up and running in your local machine, do
- `lein figwheel dev`

You should now be able to see my site in `localhost:3449`
